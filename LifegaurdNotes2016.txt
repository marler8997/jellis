Health Care Provider CPR Course
===================================================

Introduction
------------------------------------------
    BLS = "Basic Life Support"

    How to assess and respond to
        1. Heart Attack (blocked vessel in heart)
        2. Cardiac Arrest (abnormal or no rhythm)
        3. Stroke (Vessel is blocked or ruptured (in brain?))
        4. Airway Obstruction
    AAOS = American Academy of Orthapaedic Surgeons
    ACEP = American College of Emergency Physicians
    ECSI = Emergency Care and Safety Institute
        Deliver highest quality training programs

Personal Safety
------------------------------------------
    1. Evaluate safety of a scene
    2. Decrease risk of disease transmission when providing care
    3. Explain how good samaritan laws protect a rescuer
    4. Obtain consent before providing care
    5. Explain need for PPE (personal protective equipment)
    6. Understand "stressors" with emergency care

1. Assess Scene Safety
    - Signs of immediate danger such as hazardous materials, electric currents, or environment instability
    - DO NOT ENTER SCENE unless it is safe or you have the proper training/equipment
2. Obtain Consent
    - If victim is responsive, state your name/training/experience and ask if you can help
    - Keep victim informed of your actions
    - Consent is implied when victim is unconscious or a child w/out a guardian
3. Use Barrier Devices (personal safety)
    - PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) like gloves/breathing devices
        - Face Mask/Face Shield/Bag-Valve mask/Wall Dispensor
    - Avoid exposure to body fluid (Use 1/4 cup of bleach and 1 gallon of water to clean up spills)
    - Wash any body fluids away immediately
4. Get support from others


Good Samaritan Guidelines
    1. Use skills you have been trained for
    2. Use common sense
    3. Do your best to save a life or prevent further injury

Good Samaritan immumity generally applies to:
    1. Acting during an emergency
    2. Acting in good faith (he/she has good intentions)
    3. Acting without compensation
    4. Not guilty of malicious misconduct or gross neglegence toward the victivm)


Heart and Lungs
------------------------------------------
Stroke: disruption of blood supply to the brain
Cardiac Arrest: heart stops beating
Heart Attack: An area of the heart does not receive enough oxygen and begins to die.  Usually caused by a blocked artey in the heart.
Respiratory Arrest: Lungs fail to receive oxygen.

Prevention
------------------------------------------
Exercise
Control of high blood pressure
Control of high cholesterol
Avoid smoking

What increases risk?
    Age, Diabetes, Obesity, Stress

Accessing EMS (Emergency Medical Services)
------------------------------------------
To determine if a victim is unresponsive you should: SHAKE the victim on the shoulder and SHOUT "Are you okay?"

CPR
------------------------------------------
1. Check for signs of circulation (a pulse), Should take less then 10 seconds.
2. If no signs of circulation, respond with 30 chest compressions at a rate of AT LEAST 100 per minute.
   Place the heel of one hand on the sternum, and the other hand on top of the first.  Compress chest by 2 inches.
3. Open the airway and provide 2 rescue breaths.
4. Repeat until
    The victim regains responsiveness, you become exhausted, the scene becomes hazardoes, an AED is ready, or your are relieved by another rescuer

Note: the cycle should take about 25 seconds (30 compressions and 2 breaths)
Note: if the victim has relaxed and closed their airway, reposition the head (tilt the head back/chin up)

2-rescuer CPR
In this case, for children and infants change compression to breath ratio to 15:2.
One rescuer performs compressions and the other provides rescue breaths.  The rescuer providing
breaths should also check for a pulse. Switch tasks if necessary.

Rescue Breathing: The victim shows signs of circulation (a pulse) but is not breathing.
    1 breath every 5 - 6 seconds for an adult
    Note: if you cannot make the chest rise, then reposition the airway, if that still does not work, the airway is obstructed, so perform CPR to relieve an airway obstruction.
Recovery Position:
    Victim on their side, this protects the airway by allowing fluid to drain out of the mouth.
    An unresponsive, breathing victim should be placed in the Recovery Position.

Defribulation
------------------------------------------
Chances of survival is directly related to amount of time between cardiac arrest and difribulation (around 10% every minute)

If the victim has no signs of ciculation, you may interrupt CPR to apply an AED.

1. Power the AED on
2. Apply adhesive pads to the victims bare chest
3. Stand clear of the victim
4. AED determines "shockable" or "not shockable"
5. If "shockable", then follow instructions to administer the shock

If "not shockable" and the victim is still unresponsible/has no pulse, then provide 2 minutes of CPR and allow, then allow the AED to re-analyze the victim.

Precautions:

1. Dry a wet victim's chest with a clean towel
2. Only use on an unresponsive victim with not signs of circulation
3. Stand clear while the AED is operating
4. Place around pacemaker and remove nitroglycerin patches

Advanced Care
------------------------------------------
Oral Airways: Used to maintain an open airway. Come in different sizes.
Nasal Airway: Used if patiest is responsive or has a gag reflex
Ventilation Masks: Covers victims mouth and nose, provides a one-way valve to prevent rescuer from coming in contact with the victims breath or fluids.
Bag-Valve Mask(BVM): Uses a bag instead of the recuers breath.  Usually requires 2 people to operate efficiently, so that one can use 2 hands to hold the mask tight.
  Note: most common problem is maintaining an open airway
Supplemental Oxygen Support(SOS): Delivers high concentrations of oxygen to breathing and non-breathing victims.  Import to have training to operate.
Suction Devices: Removes fluids from a victim's mouth (like vomit).
  Note: Vomiting is common during resuscitation and is a threat to the victims airway. Turn the victims head to the side to drain fluid and clear any large debres with a finger sweep.


Heart Attack
------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
    - Persistent chest pain lasting more than 3 to 5 minutes
    - Chest pain that travels to the neck, jaw or down the arm
    - Nasea, dizziness, extreme fatigue
    - Shortness of breath or trouble breathing
    - Sweating or cold sweat without fever

Prompt activation of EMS is crucial

While waiting, get an AED ready and get ready to perform CPR

Stroke
------------------------------------------
Causes: Blocked or Ruptured vessel to the brain
Symptoms:
    - Facial Droop
    - Altered responsiveness and/or severe headache
    - Visual Problems or Dizziness
    - Speaking difficulty or slurred speech
    - Weakness or paralysis of one or more limbs

EMS must be administered within 3 hours to control brain dammage

Airway Obstruction
------------------------------------------
If victim cannot cough or emit sound, they have no air exchange and require immediate recuer assistance.
A victim with a partially blocked airway will be able to cough or speak and will likely be able to free the object without direct assistance (encourage them to cough the obstruction free).

Signs:
    - Severe breathing difficulty
    - Changes in skin appearance or blue lips (cyanosis)
    - High pitched noises or inability to speak
    - Universal choking sign (clutching the throat)

How to perform abdominal thrusts:
    1. Make a fist with your thumb just above the navel
    2. Clasp your fist with your other hand
    3. Pull inward and upward with quick thrusts
    4. Continue the thrusts until the obstruction is removed or the victim becomes unresponsive

Note: if the victim is pregnant or too fat to reach around, perform chest compressions instead.  Line up the thumb in your first with the victims breastbone.

Perform abdominal thrusts on YOURSELF:
    If you are alone and choking, you can perform the thrusts yourself (line up thumb of the fist just above the navel).
    Or you can thrust your abdomen over a firm object, a chair could work.

With partial obstruction, encourage the victim to cough to free the object.


Pediatrics
------------------------------------------
Unlike adults, EMS can be called 2 minutes after giving care (for adults the EMS should be notified immediately).

Differences:


Reference Table
Choking         : Infant: back blows/chest thrusts
Rescue Breathing: Infant/Child: Breath every 3 - 5 seconds
CPR Compression : Infant/Child: 1/3 of chest depth (not 2" like adults)
CPR Compression : Infant: 2 fingers, child: 1 or 2 hands, adult: 2 hands

Choking
    - Place infant face DOWN on the forearm supporting head/jaw (keep head lower than body)
    - Deliver up to five back blows (slaps) between the infant's shoulder blands using the heel of your hand
    - Turn the infant face up
    - Deliver up to five chest thrusts (using two fingers on the sternum)


===================================================
Lifeguarding Course
===================================================

Textbook Chapter 1: Professional and Accountable Lifeguards
------------------------------------------
10/20 Protection Standard
    10 seconds to recognize and emergency, 20 seconds to reach the guest

Skills
    1. Anticipate: Be mentally and physically prepared to respond to an emergency
    2. Recognize: Maintain vigilance for scanning strategies and the 10/20 protection standard.
    3. Manage

The "standard of care" is the degree of care that a responsible person is expected to provide in preventing or managing the injury or illness of others.  It also takes into account what other, similarly qualified practitioners would have done.

For lifeguards who completed ILTP (International Lifeguard Training Program) this consists of:
    - Proactive simmer protection that meets the 10/20 protection rule
    - Maintaining lifeguard skills (including rescues at a test-ready level)
    - Maintaining a professional image
    - Using available equipment effectively and safely
    - Using personal protection measures and equipment to mitigate risks arising from on-the-job hazards
    - Working effectively to follow the facility's EAP

Maintaining a professional image
    - Practice personal safety
    - Get plenty of rest
    - Be Punctual
    - Maintain vigilance
    - Be rescue ready (always be test-ready)
    - Practice excellent customer service
    - Know, enforce, and model rules
    - Be a team player

Using a Rescue Tube
    - Helps minimize personal danger during a rescue
    - Identifies lifeguards on duty
    - Can support several large people
    - Positioned between the lifeguard and the guest for protection
    - If guest is not breathing, can be used to position the guest in an open airway position to facilitate rescue breathing in the water
    - Can be used to support a backboard in the water during extrications where a spinal injury is suspected
    Note: be sure to take up any slack when holding the tube so it doesn't get caught on anything

Sunglasses tips
    - Polarized: Reduces glare on the surface of the water
    - UVA and UVB Protection
    - Meets ANSI Z80.3 blocking requirements
    - Grey/Green/Brown lens will have the least color distortion.  Yellow and rose will have the most.

Sunscreen tips
    - SPF 15 or higher will absorb most ultraviolet type B (UVB)
    - Make sure it is labeled "Broad Spectrum", which means it covers UVB and UVA.
    - "Water Resistant" means it maintains it's rating in water for at least 40 minutes, "Water Proff" is 80 minutes.

Protection from Infectious Disease
    - Use PPE "Personal protective equipment" like gloves/eyewear/breathing devices.
    - Dispose of contaminated and sharp materials properly
    - Clean hands and other areas that may have been exposed to bodily fluids

Questions
   Professional lifeguards who are trained in the ILTP are taught to anticipate, recognize and manage aquatic emergencies.
     TRUE
   "Standard of care" means that individual lifeguards set the standard of care they plan on providing a guest
     FALSE
   It is optional for lifeguards to wear sunscreen and sunglasses when working outside in sunny conditions
     FALSE
   Lifeguards perform well when evaluated because they perform well at all times while on duty
     TRUE

Textbook Chapter 2: The Vigilant Lifeguard
------------------------------------------

Scanning patterns
    - All scanning includes downward head movement
    - Develop scanning patters that work for you, here are some
        * Alphabet Scanning
        * Circular Scanning
        * Figure Eight Scanning
        * Roving lifeguards Curve Scanning
        * Side-to-side Scanning
        * Up and down Scanning
        * Triangle Scanning
        * Scanning around and underneath objects
        * Scan along the wall

Distractions to avoid
    - Fatigue: Environmental/mental
    - Social: Guests/friends/family/staff
    - Secondary Duties: Other responsibilities that are incompatible with the 10/20 standard.

To minimize fatigue maintain frequent changes
    - Change your scanning pattern
    - Change your body position
    - Limit time at positions/duties and rotate often
    - Strategic lifeguard breaks

Social distractions can be unavoidable, however, they cannot prevent you from maintaining the 10/20 standard.  If someone requires more direct attention, alert a supervisor (or other staff) to assist.

A GID "Guest In Distress" is a guest who needs the immediate assistance of a lifeguard.
A GID will be in 1 of 3 vertical locations:
    1. On the surface
    2. Below the surface within arms reach of the surface
    3. Below the surface beyond arms reach of the surface
Signs of an "Active GID"
    - Body Position
         * Body position vertical or diagonal
         * Legs not kicking
         * Arms extended, maybe trying to reach/grab for something
         * May be turned towards safety (wall/lifeguard/lane line)
    - Movement: Little to no forward movement
    - Appearance: Expending all energy to stay above water.  Look of fear/panic.
    - Breathing: Head held back to keep mouth above water.  Possibly little to no calling out for help.

If you notice anything blow the surface of a pool and cannot identify it, go check it out.
"If you don't know, GO!"
Any lack of movement demands immediate attention.

The Drowning Process
    1. Surprise
    2. Respiratory Arrest
    3. Unconsiousness
    4. Hypoxic Convulsions (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain, person appears rigid/stiff/jerks violently and can froth from the mouth)
    5. Cardiac Arrest
    6. Death
Passive Drowning (caused by heart attack, stroke, blackouts, seizures, head injury, drugs, or alcohol)
Active Drowning (May struggle on the surface for a short period before submerging)


High-Risk Guests
    - Children and Elderly
    - Non-swimmers or weak swimmers not wearing a life jacket
    - Guests with life jackets
    - Guests who have consumed drugs/alcohol
    - Guests prone to illness
High-Risk Locations
    - Children's activity pools
    - Slide catch pools
    - Wave Pools
    - Traditional Lap Pools
High-Risk Times
    - Conscious active guests and unconscious: Noon to 4PM
    - Suspected spinals: 3PM to 6PM
    - Non-Aquatic: 9AM to Noon, and 3PM to 6PM

Questions
    Your supervisor may interrupt your 10/20 protection standard if needed without having someone else cover your Zone of Protection area.
      FALSE
    Guests in distress who are experiencing passive drowning cover all stages of the drowning process
      FALSE (may immediately loose consciousness and require immediate BLS (Basic Life Support) care)
    Shallow water is not as dangerous as deep water
      FALSE (Shallow water is more likely to have a major incident than deep water)


Textbook Chapter 3: The Lifeguard team
------------------------------------------

Primary means of communication by lifeguards are WHISTLE and HAND SIGNALS.

Default Whistle Signals
  - TWO SHORT BLASTS: Get the attention of another guard

Default Hand Signals
  - TAPPING THE TOP OF HEAD: Cover my zone

During an emergency, backup should be available to provide zone coverage assistance.
If no backup is available, the zone should be cleared and closed until backup is available.

EAP should detail how zone coverage is accomplished.

During rotation, both guards complete a proactive bottom scan.


Questions
    A lifeguard can function without any assistance during an emergency
      FALSE
    A whistle is an optional piece of equipment
      FALSE
    I would use TWO SHORT WHISTLE BLASTS to get another lifeguard's attention, along with TAPPING THE TOP OF MY HEAD to indicate that I need a lifeguard to cover my Zone of Protection.
      TRUE


Textbook Chapter 4: Guest Relations and Additional Responsibilities
------------------------------------------

Rule Enforcement
    - Know where the rules are posted and point them out
    - Understand and be able to explain the rules
    - Be consistent with every guest
    - Be positive/polite/respectful

Crowd Control
    - Keep calm
    - Speak loudly and clearly
    - Give precise, simple directions
    - Speak with authority
Incident Reports must be completed immediately afterwards.

Rain
    - Rain cause hinder 10/20 beacuse it can hinder underwater vision.  To much rain can make it impossible to see below the surface.

Questions
    The "C" in "C.A.R.E" stands for "Charisma" as in, the best lifeguards have it.
      FALSE (It stands for Confidence)
    Lifeguards can enhance both safety and the enjoyment of guests who are non-swimmers, weak swimmers or children by:
      "Encouraging the use of properly fitted and worn life jackets"


Textbook Chapter 5: Active Guest in Distress Rescues
------------------------------------------

Assist: Help a guest while maintaining 10/20
Rescue: Cannot maintain 10/20.  Means you must activate EAP and fill out a rescue report.

Assists from the Deck
    - Arm Extension
        * Keep body low and away from water
        * Extend arm and grasp the guests WRIST or ARM
        * Move guest to safety and assist out of water (if appropriate)
    - Rescue Tube Extension
        * Offer the guest the rescue tube
        * Place the rescue tube or strap loop in the guests hands
        * Move guest to safety and assist out of water (if appropriate)

If performing an assist is not possible, then ACTIVATE EAP
    - Blow whistle and point to GID.
        * By default the lifeguard to your left should cover your zone at this point
    - Execute a safe water entry and approach.
        * Use the compact jump (unless it's a spinal)
        * Maintain control of the rescue tube

Compact Jump (Goal is to stay at the surface and maintain eye contact with GID)
    - Take in strap slack to prevent it from catching
    - Position tube across chest under armpits
    - Jump with legs together, knees bent, and feet flat
Approach Stroke (Breaststroke or Front Crawl)
    - Keep eyes on guest and rescue tube in front of chest

Rescue Before and After (Where you cannot maintain 10/20)
-------------------------------
[Before Rescue]
    - Whistle, point to guest, compact jump
    Note: this will notify other guards to cover your zone
    Note: if you will need help, signal by raising a clenched fist before entering the water
    - Swim towards guest with rescue tube underneath your armpits (or trailing you if you need more speed)

[Perform Rescue]

[After Rescue]
    - Assist guest from the water and make sure they are in good condition.
    - Complete rescue report


Front Drive (Guest on surface facing you)
    [Perform Before Rescue]
    - When close, pull the rescue tube from under your arms and push it out in front of you with both arms locked.
    - As you near the guest, push the tube slightly underwater and drive it into the chest of the guest.  Keep arms locked straight.
    - Encourage the guest to hold on to the tube.
    - Communicate with the guest and keep kicking to maintain your momentum till at the side of the pool.

    If guest grabs you, you may need to perform
        - Front Hug (Good for smaller guest)
            * Reach under guest's arms and hug the guest
            * Keep head slightly to the side to guest cannot hurt you
        - Flip-Over technique (You are being forced underwater, guest is around your size)
            * Position yourself above the guest
        - The push away technique (Cannot control the guest)
            * Leaving rescue tube with guest, get some air, tuck your chin and submerge while the guest away on the tube
            * Reapproach the guest or signal help from a second lifeguard
    [Perform After Rescue]

Rear Hug (Guest on surface facing AWAY from you)
    [Perform Before Rescue]
    - When you reach the guest, extend your arms under their armpits and wrap your hands around their shoulders/chest or waist to elevate them above the surface.
    - Pull the guest onto the tube while keeping your head to the side. Talk to the guest until you reach safety.
    [Perform After Rescue]

Two-Lifeguard Rescue (GID is too large or active for one guard)
    [Perform Before Rescue]
    - Primary rescuer raises a fist above their head to indicate the need for assistance from another guard.
    - The second lifeguard performs a Rear Hug while the first guard performs a front drive.
    [Perform After Rescue]

Duck and Pluck rescue (Submerged guest within reach from surface)
    [Perform Before Rescue]
    - Grasp rescue tube with one hand.
    - Reach over the tube to grab the wrist of the submerged guest
    - Pull them up and with the other hand push the rescue tube under their armpits
    [Perform After Rescue]

Deep Water Rescue (Submerged guest beyond reach from surface)
    [Perform Before Rescue]
    - When directly above the guest, stop and release the rescue tube from under your armpits (be sure the strap is still across your chest/shoulder)
    - Execute a feet-first surface dive
    - With one hand, reach across the guest's chest under the armpits. Feed the strap of the rescue tube into that hand.
    - Continue feeding the strap as you move toward the surface (make sure at least one hand is always holding the strap)
    - When you reach the surface, position the rescue tube appropriately based on the guest's condition
    [Perform After Rescue]

Questions
    If a guest is in trouble but far away from you in the water, you should perform an assist
      FALSE (you should activate EAP and perform a rescue)
    To perform the compact jump safely, the lifeguard should keep their feet flat and knees bent
      TRUE
    A guest in distress who is active and facing away can best be rescued using the rear hug
      TRUE
    The two-guard rescue includes the combination of the front drive and duck pluck rescues
      FALSE (should be the front driver and the rear hug)
    The key objectives to accomplish while rescuing multiple guests in distress is to keep guests on the surface and to remember my personal safety
      TRUE (your own safety is highest priority)
    To execute a deep water rescue on an ACTIVE GID, a lifeguard must
      "Grasp the guest across his or her chest or armpit"




Textbook Chapter 6: Respiratory Emergencies
------------------------------------------

Agonal Breathing
    An unresponsive guest may have occasional gasping breaths called "agonal breaths".  This occurs in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.  These are INNEFFECTIVE breaths and should not be confused with adequate breathing.  This occurs in about 50% of all guests experiencing cardiac arrest and indicates rescue breathing should be performed, along with CPU if pulse is absent.

Rescue Breathing
    [Without BVM (Bag-Valve Mask)]
        * 1 breath every 5 seconds for adult, 3 seconds for children
        Each breath should take 1 second and you should see the guest's chest rise
    
    
Has Pulse but Not Breathing.  
    - Open the airway (Perform head tilt)
    - Perform Rescue Breathing
        

Begins to vomit
    - Put guest in recovery position.
    - "LogRoll" the guest onto their side, then position upper leg forward to support their position
    
    




Reacting to an emergency
------------------------------------------
When you hear a whistle signaling an emergency, you should immeidately check the lifeguard to your right and cover his/her zone if necessary.
If there are not enough guards to cover the zones during a rescue, the attraction/facility must be closed temporarily and all guests cleared from the water.
Note: Remember to assess scene safety before entering a scene.
Note: Remember BSI (Body Substance Isolation)
    - Wear Gloves and wash immediately after removing them
    - Use Protective equipment for eyes/mouth
    - Dispose of needles and sharp objects properly
    - Clean other areas that might have been exposed to bodily fluids
Communication
    - Whistles (required to have one at all times while on duty)
    - Hand Signals
    - Other Devices (megaphones, etc)
Whistle
    - One short blast - Get attention of guests
    - Two short blasts - Get attention of lifeguards
        afterwards raise your hand or touch your head to let them know it was you who whistled
    - One long blast - Activate your EAP
        You are leaving your zone to perform a rescue, someone needs to cover your zone
        Point to where you are going
        (stop waves if in a wave pool)
    - Two long blasts - Major emergency
        May be a life-threatening situation in which several lifeguards/facility personnel are involved or needed.
        Pool may need to be closed immediately and guests cleared from the area.
Hand Signals
    - Rase Clenched Fist - I need help
        Can be used with a whistle blast
    - Crossed arms above the head - Stop dispatch of riders on water attractions.
        Can be used with a whistle blast to indicate a rescue in progress.
    - Thumbs up - It's alright to resume activity
    - Tapping the top of your head - Watch my area
        Usually accompanied by whistle blasts
Phone Numbers: 911 (EMS) 800-222-1222 (Poison Control)
Communcation Devices: Telephone, Radio, Megaphone, PA

"Assist": 10/20 maintained and EAP NOT activated
"Rescue": EAP activated (10/20 not maintained)

The average rescue tube can support up to 5 people in the water.
Rescue tube is placed between the lifeguard and the guest to protect the guard.
The rescue tube can also be used to help keep a guests airway open if they are not breathing.

Note: Some positions may not be required to wear a tube at all times (like a guard at

How to hold rescue tube:
    - When seated, hold in you lap

Rotation:
    - Incoming guard performs bottom scan.
    - Equipment is transferred. (if only one rescue tube)
    - Incoming guard takes the stand while outgoing scans zone.
    - Both guards scan zone.

Always have your rescue tube ready!














Rules, Relations and Responsibilities
------------------------------------------
Guest on the Surface-Breathing
------------------------------------------
Extension Assist
    Extend a body part/pole/rescue tube.
    No need for EAP if you maintain 10/20.
    Stay low
    In an arm assist, grab the guests wrist
Unlike assists, rescues require an incident report. They are also classified in 2 ways:
    1. Distressed Simmer Rescue - Guest who has shown an inability to remain at the surface.
    2. Submersion Incident Rescue - Rescuing an unconscious and submerged guest
Rescue Situations
    - Guest on surface, breathing
    - Guest on surface, not breathing
    - Submerged - within reach
    - Submerged - beyond reach
EAP ensures that all zones are covered.


Guest on the surface not breathing
------------------------------------------
1. Perform a rear hug rescue
2. Pull the guest backward across the rescue tube; Signal for equipment (backboard/resuscitation mask), Once it arrives, perform rescue breathing
3. Note: use Jaw-thrust with head tilt to open the airway

Rescue Breathing and Airway Management
------------------------------------------
Opening Airway of Unconscious guest
    1. Jaw thrust with Head Tilt
    2. Head tilt withe chain lift
    3. (Possible Neck Injury) Jaw thrust WITHOUT Head Tilt
For Unconscious guests, occasional gasping breaths may be "Agonal Breaths", which are ineffective.  If you see agonal breaths, then rescue breathing should be provided.

Rapid Extraction
    Can be done with as few as 2 lifeguards using a backgoard.
    Only used when guest is not breathing and does not have a suspected spinal injury.

1. Primary lifeguard moves the guest toward the side of the pool
2. Secondary lifeguard places the backboard vertical underwater against the side of the pool.
3. Primary guard moves to the side and raises the guest's arms so the secondary lifeguard can grasp the wrist.
    - Primary guard slides the rescue tube away before the guest rests on the backboard
4. Secondary guard holds the backboard with one hand and the guest's wrist in the other.
    - Primary guard stabalizes the backboard in the water.

Once on land
- Move the guest 6 feet from the edge of the water.
- Check responsiveness, if not responsive, check for signs of obvious breathing such as chest movement, then check for pulse.
- If no pulse and no breathing, begin CPR and communicate the need for an AED.
- If guest has a pulse but no breathing, perform rescue breathing for 2 minutes.

Spinal Injury Management
------------------------------------------
Causes
    - Blows/Dives/Falls
    - When the neck is extended or flexed to far, common in diving injuries
Signs
    - Blood around ears/nose
    - Confusion
    - Deformity around neck
    - Bruising around face/heck/neck
    - Neck/Back pain
    - Numbness/tingling/inability to move limbs or neck normally
Care for spinal injury is a team effort.
For a spinal injury, do not perform a compact jump if they are close to you, instead, ease gently into the water so as not to disturb the surface
Use a ViceGrip rescue
    - FaceUp Vice Grip (Overarm Vice Grip)
        - Use one arm to grsp the guests arms just above the elbows at or around the ears, Press arms agains the ears
    - If the guest is face-down, use the Underarm Vicegrip to roll them face-up
If they are in deep water, perform the vice grip underwater and move diagonally to the surface to minize bending of the spine
    Roll them face up as you ascend to the surface


Handling Risks
------------------------------------------
Lifeguard should be involved in at least 4 hours of in-service training each month
Handling Risks
    - Eye Injury: Polarized Ultraviolet Sunglasses
Best Defense against a lawsuit
    - Be Attentive, Effecient and Skilled


CPR and AED
------------------------------------------
AED Special Concerns
    - Water: keep guest at least 6 feet away from pool.  Dry chest and pads.
    - Children: Some AEDs have special pads for children
    - Remove any medication patches underneath pads.
    - Do not place pads directly above pacemakers

Supplemental Oxygen Support
------------------------------------------
Do not expose to temperatures above 130 degrees F (54 degress C)

BVM (Bag Valve Mask)
    - Self-refilling bag
    - Non-rebreathing valve
    - Various sizes for children and adults
    - Reservoir system for high concentrations of oxygen
    - Most Common Problem: Failure to provide an adequate volume of air

Exam Notes
===================================================
* The non-breathing mask attached to a supplemental oxygen system is a device that can be used by lifeguards when the following symptoms are found:
    Conscious breathing guests who have difficulty breathing and/or are suffering from a medical condition that requires supplemental oxygen, such as a heart attack, stroke, seizure, or a recent submersion event
* The ILTP Course Completion Card and E&A License are valid for?
    1 Year from date of course completion
* How can a lifeguard team modify the use of an adult bag valve mask (BVM) for use on children?
    The lifeguard squeezing the bag carefully observes the chest.  The lifeguard squeezes just enough to produce visible chest rise.
* Rapid extrication procedures:
    Are used to quickly and safely remove a non-breathing guest from the water
* Lifeguard Rotation?
    Incoming lifeguard performance a profound, proactive bottom scan to determine if the zone is clear.  Once the zone is clear, the incoming lifeguard can begin normal scanning while the outgoing lifeguard performance a profound, proactive bottom scan to determine if the zone is clear.  The lifeguards should signal to each other that both have determined that the zone is clear before the rotation is complete.
* Shallow save
    Duck pluck rescue
* Duck Pluck rescue on a submerged guest
    Rescuer holds the tube in the middle with one hand while the other hand is used to reach over the tube toward the guest.  The may require the lifeguard's head to be submerged to grab the guest's hand or arm to pull him or her to the surface.
* C.A.R.E
    confidence, alertness, responsiveness, empathy
* Technique used to immobilize the head and neck of a guest with a suspected spinal injury
    Vice grip
* When the lifeguard team is securing a guest to a backboard, the team should
    Secure the guest's body (chest, hips, thighs, and lower legs) to the backboard before securing the head (using a head immobilizer)
* For documentation and reporting, rescures are classified in one of two ways depending on the severity of the incident.
    A "Distressed Swimmer Rescue" and a "Submersion Incident Rescue"
* When a lifeguard provides breaths for a non-breathing guest with an open airway and a pulse, that lifeguard is performing
    Rescue Breathing
* What are the first basic steps lifeguards follow when presented with a submerged guest with a suspected spinal injury?
    Lifeguards should position their bodies so that they are just above the submerged guest. Feet-first surface dive to the depth of the guest and apply the vise grip, just as would be done at the surface.  Bring the guest up on a diagonal approach, slowly turning the guests face up as you ascend.
* Two lifeguards are backboarding a large man who performanced a deep water dive in the shallow end.  What techniques will assist the lifeguards in managing the large guest?
    The lifeguard team can bring the guest to shallow water (if possible) so they can stand without support of the rescue tubes.
    Once the guest is placed on the board, a rescue tube can be placed under the board, near the feet to provide added stability while the guest is being secured.
    When it is time to extricate, the lifeguards should slide the board onto the deck using good communication and teamwork, avoiding lifting the board (if possible)
* AED used to treat:
    No pulse, which may be caused by ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* How do lifeguards reduce likelihood of being held liable?
    Always stay attentive and maintain the 10/20 protection standard; attend regular documented in-service training to maintain skills; act maturely and professional while on duty
* Proper location for a one-rescuer CPR on an infant?
    2 fingers on the breatbone, just below the nipple line
* CPR compressions and breath ratios
    Single rescuer, all age groups: 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths.
    Multiple rescuers: adult, 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths.
                       child/infant, 15 compressions followed by 2 breaths
* BSI (Body substance isolation) refers to:
    Treating all body fluids as if they are contaminated and using appropriate PPE (personal protective devices) to avoid direct contact
* 10/20 protection standard:
    Allow up to 10 seconds to recognize a guest in distress, and 20 seconds to reach and render aid
* CAB sequence for basic life support
    If they are unresponsive and no obvious signs of breathing:
        - Activate the EAP/EMS
        - Request an AED
        - Take BSI precautions
        - First check the pulse, after not finding one, immediately begin CPR (begin with compressions)
        -  Call for an AED to be prepared and attached
* Guest is partially submerged and appears rigid with jerking motions.  Skin is blue and froth is coming from the mouth.
    This is the Hypoxic convulsions stage
* NOTE: EAP = Emergency Action Plan
* A lifeguard is on the stand with no lifeguard to her left. Who will maintain her zone if she has to perform a rescue?
    The lifeguard to her right can cover the zone, or if possible, the lifeguard directly accross the pool can cover the zone of protection, following the facility's EAP.
* While scanning your zone of protection it is best to:
    Rescue all guests who show any signs of distress.  If you are not sure or if you don't know, go!
* The AED
    Can be used on a person of any age when they are found: unconscious, without ibvious normal breathing, and without a definite pulse
* Infant choking
    Support the infant's head and neck, and firmly administer five back blows and then five chest thrusts, repeating until the baby can breathe or becomes unconscious.
* AED has been applied to a guest. Next step is:
    Immediately perform CPR, beginning with compressions until prompted by the AED to stand clear (approximately 2 mintues)
* ILTP course requires lifeguard to
    Shallow water lifeguards: 50 yards; Pool lifeguards: 100 yards; Special Facilities lifeguards: 200 yards
* Rescue breathing for children is performed at a rate of
    1 rescue breath every 3 - 5 seconds
* Note: lifeguard must wear the recue tube at all times
* Suspected spinal injury on deck (non-aquatic)
    Focus on basic stabilization and prevention of further injury until qualified emergency medical professionals arrive
* When using AED, one thing to consider
    The wet deck and the need to move the guest at least six feet away from the water (to use the AED)
* Hot day, woman started twitching then stopped.  Guest is not conscious and responding slowly to questions but seems confused.  She may have had a seizure, because:
    Heatstroke or fever, head injury, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
* Factors that make it difficult for a lifeguard to recognize a guest in distress include
    Location in the water, glare, and water clarity
