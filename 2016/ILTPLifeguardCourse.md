ILTP Lifeguarding Course
==========================================

Textbook Chapter 1: Professional and Accountable Lifeguards
------------------------------------------

##### 10/20 Protection Standard

10 seconds to recognize and emergency, 20 seconds to reach the guest

##### Skills
1. **Anticipate:** Be mentally and physically prepared to respond to an emergency
2. **Recognize:** Maintain vigilance for scanning strategies and the 10/20 protection standard.
3. **Manage**

The **standard of care** is the degree of care that a responsible person is expected to provide in preventing or managing the injury or illness of others.  It also takes into account what other, similarly qualified practitioners would have done.

For lifeguards who completed ILTP (International Lifeguard Training Program) this consists of:
- Proactive simmer protection that meets the 10/20 protection rule
- Maintaining lifeguard skills (including rescues at a test-ready level)
- Maintaining a professional image
- Using available equipment effectively and safely
- Using personal protection measures and equipment to mitigate risks arising from on-the-job hazards
- Working effectively to follow the facility's EAP

##### Maintaining a professional image
- Practice personal safety
- Get plenty of rest
- Be Punctual
- Maintain vigilance
- Be rescue ready (always be test-ready)
- Practice excellent customer service
- Know, enforce, and model rules
- Be a team player

##### Using a Rescue Tube
- Helps minimize personal danger during a rescue
- Identifies lifeguards on duty
- Can support several large people
- Positioned between the lifeguard and the guest for protection
- If guest is not breathing, can be used to position the guest in an open airway position to facilitate rescue breathing in the water
- Can be used to support a backboard in the water during extrications where a spinal injury is suspected
Note: be sure to take up any slack when holding the tube so it doesn't get caught on anything

##### Sunglasses tips
- Polarized: Reduces glare on the surface of the water
- UVA and UVB Protection
- Meets ANSI Z80.3 blocking requirements
- Grey/Green/Brown lens will have the least color distortion.  Yellow and rose will have the most.

##### Sunscreen tips
- SPF 15 or higher will absorb most ultraviolet type B (UVB)
- Make sure it is labeled "Broad Spectrum", which means it covers UVB and UVA.
- "Water Resistant" means it maintains it's rating in water for at least 40 minutes, "Water Proff" is 80 minutes.

##### Protection from Infectious Disease
- Use PPE "Personal protective equipment" like gloves/eyewear/breathing devices.
- Dispose of contaminated and sharp materials properly
- Clean hands and other areas that may have been exposed to bodily fluids

### Questions
- Professional lifeguards who are trained in the ILTP are taught to anticipate, recognize and manage aquatic emergencies.
  - TRUE
- "Standard of care" means that individual lifeguards set the standard of care they plan on providing a guest
  - FALSE
- It is optional for lifeguards to wear sunscreen and sunglasses when working outside in sunny conditions
  - FALSE
- Lifeguards perform well when evaluated because they perform well at all times while on duty
  - TRUE

Textbook Chapter 2: The Vigilant Lifeguard
------------------------------------------

##### Scanning patterns
- All scanning includes downward head movement
- Develop scanning patters that work for you, here are some
  * Alphabet Scanning
  * Circular Scanning
  * Figure Eight Scanning
  * Roving lifeguards Curve Scanning
  * Side-to-side Scanning
  * Up and down Scanning
  * Triangle Scanning
  * Scanning around and underneath objects
  * Scan along the wall

##### Distractions to avoid
- Fatigue: Environmental/mental
- Social: Guests/friends/family/staff
- Secondary Duties: Other responsibilities that are incompatible with the 10/20 standard.

##### To minimize fatigue maintain frequent changes
- Change your scanning pattern
- Change your body position
- Limit time at positions/duties and rotate often
- Strategic lifeguard breaks

Social distractions can be unavoidable, however, they cannot prevent you from maintaining the 10/20 standard.  If someone requires more direct attention, alert a supervisor (or other staff) to assist.

A GID "Guest In Distress" is a guest who needs the immediate assistance of a lifeguard.
A GID will be in 1 of 3 vertical locations:
1. On the surface
2. Below the surface within arms reach of the surface
3. Below the surface beyond arms reach of the surface

Signs of an "Active GID"
- Body Position
  * Body position vertical or diagonal
  * Legs not kicking
  * Arms extended, maybe trying to reach/grab for something
  * May be turned towards safety (wall/lifeguard/lane line)
- Movement: Little to no forward movement
- Appearance: Expending all energy to stay above water.  Look of fear/panic.
- Breathing: Head held back to keep mouth above water.  Possibly little to no calling out for help.

If you notice anything blow the surface of a pool and cannot identify it, go check it out.
"If you don't know, GO!"
Any lack of movement demands immediate attention.

##### The Drowning Process
1. Surprise
2. Respiratory Arrest
3. Unconsiousness
4. Hypoxic Convulsions (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain, person appears rigid/stiff/jerks violently and can froth from the mouth)
5. Cardiac Arrest
6. Death
Passive Drowning (caused by heart attack, stroke, blackouts, seizures, head injury, drugs, or alcohol)
Active Drowning (May struggle on the surface for a short period before submerging)


##### High-Risk Guests
- Children and Elderly
- Non-swimmers or weak swimmers not wearing a life jacket
- Guests with life jackets
- Guests who have consumed drugs/alcohol
- Guests prone to illness
##### High-Risk Locations
- Children's activity pools
- Slide catch pools
- Wave Pools
- Traditional Lap Pools
##### High-Risk Times
- Conscious active guests and unconscious: Noon to 4PM
- Suspected spinals: 3PM to 6PM
- Non-Aquatic: 9AM to Noon, and 3PM to 6PM

### Questions
- Your supervisor may interrupt your 10/20 protection standard if needed without having someone else cover your Zone of Protection area.
  - FALSE
- Guests in distress who are experiencing passive drowning cover all stages of the drowning process
  - FALSE (may immediately loose consciousness and require immediate BLS (Basic Life Support) care)
- Shallow water is not as dangerous as deep water
  - FALSE (Shallow water is more likely to have a major incident than deep water)


Textbook Chapter 3: The Lifeguard team
------------------------------------------

Primary means of communication by lifeguards are WHISTLE and HAND SIGNALS.

##### Default Whistle Signals
- **One Short Blast:** Get attention of guests
- **Two Short Blasts:** Get the attention of another guard
- **One Long Blast:** Activate EAP.  Someone needs to cover your zone.  Point to where you are going.
- **Two Long Blasts:** Major Emergency. May be a life-threatening situation in which several lifeguards/facility personnel are involved or needed. Pool may need to be closed immediately and guests cleared from the area.

##### Default Hand Signals
- **Tapping top of head:** Cover my zone (usually accompanied by whistle blasts)
- **Raise clenched fist:** Need help from another staff
- **Crossed arms above head:** Stop dispatch of riders on water attractions.
- **Thumbs up:** Resume activity

During an emergency, backup should be available to provide zone coverage assistance.
If no backup is available, the zone should be cleared and closed until backup is available.

EAP should detail how zone coverage is accomplished.

During rotation, both guards complete a proactive bottom scan.


### Questions
- A lifeguard can function without any assistance during an emergency
  - FALSE
- A whistle is an optional piece of equipment
  - FALSE
- I would use TWO SHORT WHISTLE BLASTS to get another lifeguard's attention, along with TAPPING THE TOP OF MY HEAD to indicate that I need a lifeguard to cover my Zone of Protection.
  - TRUE


Textbook Chapter 4: Guest Relations and Additional Responsibilities
------------------------------------------

##### Rule Enforcement
- Know where the rules are posted and point them out
- Understand and be able to explain the rules
- Be consistent with every guest
- Be positive/polite/respectful

##### C.A.R.E
- **C**onfidence
- **A**lertness
- **R**esponsiveness
- **E**mpathy

##### For difficult situations follow the D.E.A.L philosophy
- **D**efine the problem       (**P**roblem)
- **E**valuate your options    (**O**ptions)
- **A**ct now                  (**A**ct)
- **L**ook at outcomes         (**R**eview)

##### Crowd Control
- Keep calm
- Speak loudly and clearly
- Give precise, simple directions
- Speak with authority

Incident Reports must be completed immediately afterwards.

###### Rain
- Rain cause hinder 10/20 beacuse it can hinder underwater vision.  To much rain can make it impossible to see below the surface.

### Questions
- The "C" in "C.A.R.E" stands for "Charisma" as in, the best lifeguards have it.
  - FALSE (It stands for Confidence)
- Lifeguards can enhance both safety and the enjoyment of guests who are non-swimmers, weak swimmers or children by:
  - "Encouraging the use of properly fitted and worn life jackets"


Textbook Chapter 5: Active Guest in Distress Rescues
------------------------------------------

#### Assist vs Rescue
**Assist:** Able to maintain 10/20 (did not activate EAP)

**Rescue:** Could not maintain 10/20 and activated EAP.  Must fill out a rescue report.

##### Assists
- Arm Extension
  * Keep body low and away from water
  * Extend arm and grasp the guests WRIST or ARM
  * Move guest to safety and assist out of water (if appropriate)
- Rescue Tube Extension
  * Offer the guest the rescue tube
  * Place the rescue tube or strap loop in the guests hands
  * Move guest to safety and assist out of water (if appropriate)

If performing an assist is not possible, then you must activate EAP and perform a **rescue**.

### Rescues

###### Pre-Rescue
- Whistle to activate EAP, point to guest, then compact jump
  * Note: this will notify other guards to cover your zone
  * Note: if you will need help with the guest, signal by raising a clenched fist before entering the water
- Swim towards guest with rescue tube underneath your armpits (or trailing you if you need more speed)

###### Post-Rescue
- Assist guest from the water (if appropriate)
- See that the guest is in good condition or that they are being cared for by another staff
- Complete rescue report or see that it is completed by another staff

##### Compact Jump
Goal is to stay at the surface and maintain eye contact with GID
  - Take in strap slack to prevent it from catching
  - Position tube across chest under armpits
  - Jump with legs together, knees bent, and feet flat

##### Approach Stroke (Breaststroke or Front Crawl)
Keep eyes on guest and rescue tube in front of chest

## Types of rescues

#### Front Drive
Guest on surface facing you
- Pre-Rescue (see above)
- When close, pull the rescue tube from under your arms and push it out in front of you with both arms locked.
- As you near the guest, push the tube slightly underwater and drive it into the chest of the guest.  Keep arms locked straight.
- Encourage the guest to hold on to the tube.
- Communicate with the guest and keep kicking to maintain your momentum till at the side of the pool.
- If guest grabs you, you may need to perform
  - Front Hug (Good for smaller guest)
    * Reach under guest's arms and hug the guest
    * Keep head slightly to the side to guest cannot hurt you
  - Flip-Over technique (You are being forced underwater, guest is around your size)
    * Position yourself above the guest
  - The push away technique (Cannot control the guest)
    * Leaving rescue tube with guest, get some air, tuck your chin and submerge while the guest away on the tube
    * Reapproach the guest or signal help from a second lifeguard
- Post-Rescue (see above)

#### Rear Hug
Guest on surface facing AWAY from you
- Pre-Rescue (see above)
- When you reach the guest, extend your arms under their armpits and wrap your hands around their shoulders/chest or waist to elevate them above the surface.
- Pull the guest onto the tube while keeping your head to the side. Talk to the guest until you reach safety.
- Post-Rescue (see above)

#### Two-Lifeguard Rescue
GID is too large or active for one guard
- Pre-Rescue (see above)
- Primary rescuer raises a fist above their head to indicate the need for assistance from another guard.
- The second lifeguard performs a Rear Hug while the first guard performs a front drive.
- Post-Rescue (see above)

#### Duck and Pluck rescue
Submerged guest within reach from surface
- Pre-Rescue (see above)
- Grasp rescue tube with one hand.
- Reach over the tube to grab the wrist of the submerged guest
- Pull them up and with the other hand push the rescue tube under their armpits
- Post-Rescue (see above)

#### Deep Water Rescue
Submerged guest beyond reach from surface
- Pre-Rescue (see above)
- When directly above the guest, stop and release the rescue tube from under your armpits (be sure the strap is still across your chest/shoulder)
- Execute a feet-first surface dive
- With one hand, reach across the guest's chest under the armpits. Feed the strap of the rescue tube into that hand.
- Continue feeding the strap as you move toward the surface (make sure at least one hand is always holding the strap)
- When you reach the surface, position the rescue tube appropriately based on the guest's condition
- Post-Rescue (see above)

### Questions
- If a guest is in trouble but far away from you in the water, you should perform an assist
  - FALSE (you should activate EAP and perform a rescue)
- To perform the compact jump safely, the lifeguard should keep their feet flat and knees bent
  - TRUE
- A guest in distress who is active and facing away can best be rescued using the rear hug
  - TRUE
- The two-guard rescue includes the combination of the front drive and duck pluck rescues
  - FALSE (should be the front driver and the rear hug)
- The key objectives to accomplish while rescuing multiple guests in distress is to keep guests on the surface and to remember my personal safety
  - TRUE (your own safety is highest priority)
- To execute a deep water rescue on an ACTIVE GID, a lifeguard must
  - "Grasp the guest across his or her chest or armpit"


Textbook Chapter 6: Respiratory Emergencies
------------------------------------------

##### Assessing Scene Safety and Responsiveness
- Determine scene is safely
- Assess whether the guest is responsive/conscious by speaking to them
- If guest is responsive but seems incoherent, activate EAP
- If not responsive, take BSI (Body Substance Isolation) precautions
  * Gloves
  * Avoid contact with bodily fluids
- Tap the guest on the shoulder and ask if they are ok
- If still unresponsive, activate EAP
- Check pulse and breathing (Should take less then 10 seconds)
  * Check if chest is rising/falling
  * Place ear near the mouth to listen for breathing
- If guest is breathing normally, put them in **recovery position**.
- To check for pulse in infant, you can feel the inside of the bicep.

##### Agonal Breathing
An unresponsive guest may have occasional gasping breaths called "agonal breaths".  This occurs in the first few minutes of cardiac arrest.  These are **ineffective** breaths and should not be confused with adequate breathing.  This occurs in about 50% of all guests experiencing cardiac arrest and indicates rescue breathing should be performed, along with CPR if pulse is absent.

##### Rescue Breathing (No BVM (Bag-Valve Mask))
1 breath every 5 seconds for adults, 3 seconds for children.
Each breath should take 1 second and you should see the guest's chest rise.
DO NOT wait more then 10-15 seconds between breaths.

##### Has Pulse but Not Breathing.
- Open the airway (Perform head tilt)
- Perform Rescue Breathing

##### Begins to vomit
- Put guest in recovery position
  - "LogRoll" the guest onto their side, then position upper leg forward to support their position

##### Choking Adult
**Mild Choking** is when guest is able to cough.  Encourage guest to cough as it is likely to remove the obstruction.

**Severe/Complete airway obstruction**
- Difficult breathing
- Weak/innefective cough
- Inability to speak/cry
- Bluish-gray coloring on face
- Hands clutched at throat

Ask if the guest is choking.  If they can respond verbally, encourage them to cough.  If guest cannot respond verbally but nods approval, then perform the **Heimlich maneuver**.

###### Heimlich Maneuver
- Reach around guest and place your fist just above the belly button.
- Grasp fist with the other hand and press into the abdomen with quick/inward/upward thrusts.
- Continue until object is removed or the guests becomes unresponsive.
- Note: if the guest is pregnant or too large, place hands on the center of the chest.

##### Choking Infant
- Support infants head/neck racedown on your forearm on your leg.
- Give 5 back blows (slaps) between the shoulder blades with the heel of the hand.
- Turn the infant face up, use two fingers to give 5 chest thrusts between the nipples.
- Repeat until object is removed or infant becomes unresponsive.

##### Airway Obstruction in Unresponsive Guest
- Lower guest to the ground.
- Provide 30 chest compressions (CPR).
- Open the airway and check for a foreign object. If object is visible, remove it with a **finger sweep**.
- Provide 2 breaths.
- Repeat until obstruction removed.
- Note: If a rescue breath does not cause chest to rise, it likely means the airway is not opened adequately.  Reposition the airway before providing any more breaths.
  * Remove the resuscitation mask.
  * Move the guest's head toward the chest.
  * Reapply mask and perform the **jaw thrust** to reopen the airway.
  * Reattempt the breath
  * If breath still does not cause chest to rise, assume the airway is obstructed and provide care to remove obstruction.

##### Unresponsive Guest Vomits
- Put guest in recovery position.
- Perform finger sweeps as needed.
- When available, a **suction device** can be used to remove the fluid/vomit from the guest's mouth during resuscitation.


### Questions
- Check the pulse of an unresponsive guest for up to 20 seconds
  - FALSE (up to 10 seconds)
- Rescue breathing involves giving 1 breath every 3 seconds for an unresponsive, non-breathing adult.
  - FALSE (1 breath every 5 seconds for adults, every 3 seconds for children)
- What is the name of the technique used to open the airway of an unresponsive, non-breathing guest
  - "A **jaw thrust** with **head tilt chin lift**, or **jaw thrust** alone with suspected spinal"
- To care for a responsive infant with an airway obstruction you should give:
  - "5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts, continuing until the obstruction is removed or the infant become unresponsive."
