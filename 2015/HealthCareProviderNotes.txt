===================================================

Introduction
------------------------------------------
    BLS = "Basic Life Support"

    How to assess and respond to
        1. Heart Attack (blocked vessel in heart)
        2. Cardiac Arrest (abnormal or no rhythm)
        3. Stroke (Vessel is blocked or ruptured (in brain?))
        4. Airway Obstruction
    AAOS = American Academy of Orthapaedic Surgeons
    ACEP = American College of Emergency Physicians
    ECSI = Emergency Care and Safety Institute
        Deliver highest quality training programs

Personal Safety
------------------------------------------
    1. Evaluate safety of a scene
    2. Decrease risk of disease transmission when providing care
    3. Explain how good samaritan laws protect a rescuer
    4. Obtain consent before providing care
    5. Explain need for PPE (personal protective equipment)
    6. Understand "stressors" with emergency care

1. Assess Scene Safety
    - Signs of immediate danger such as hazardous materials, electric currents, or environment instability
    - DO NOT ENTER SCENE unless it is safe or you have the proper training/equipment
2. Obtain Consent
    - If victim is responsive, state your name/training/experience and ask if you can help
    - Keep victim informed of your actions
    - Consent is implied when victim is unconscious or a child w/out a guardian
3. Use Barrier Devices (personal safety)
    - PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) like gloves/breathing devices
        - Face Mask/Face Shield/Bag-Valve mask/Wall Dispensor
    - Avoid exposure to body fluid (Use 1/4 cup of bleach and 1 gallon of water to clean up spills)
    - Wash any body fluids away immediately
4. Get support from others


Good Samaritan Guidelines
    1. Use skills you have been trained for
    2. Use common sense
    3. Do your best to save a life or prevent further injury

Good Samaritan immumity generally applies to:
    1. Acting during an emergency
    2. Acting in good faith (he/she has good intentions)
    3. Acting without compensation
    4. Not guilty of malicious misconduct or gross neglegence toward the victivm)


Heart and Lungs
------------------------------------------
Stroke: disruption of blood supply to the brain
Cardiac Arrest: heart stops beating
Heart Attack: An area of the heart does not receive enough oxygen and begins to die.  Usually caused by a blocked artey in the heart.
Respiratory Arrest: Lungs fail to receive oxygen.

Prevention
------------------------------------------
Exercise
Control of high blood pressure
Control of high cholesterol
Avoid smoking

What increases risk?
    Age, Diabetes, Obesity, Stress

Accessing EMS (Emergency Medical Services)
------------------------------------------
To determine if a victim is unresponsive you should: SHAKE the victim on the shoulder and SHOUT "Are you okay?"

CPR
------------------------------------------
1. Check for signs of circulation (a pulse), Should take less then 10 seconds.
2. If no signs of circulation, respond with 30 chest compressions at a rate of AT LEAST 100 per minute.
   Place the heel of one hand on the sternum, and the other hand on top of the first.  Compress chest by 2 inches.
3. Open the airway and provide 2 rescue breaths.
4. Repeat until
    The victim regains responsiveness, you become exhausted, the scene becomes hazardoes, an AED is ready, or your are relieved by another rescuer

Note: the cycle should take about 25 seconds (30 compressions and 2 breaths)
Note: if the victim has relaxed and closed their airway, reposition the head (tilt the head back/chin up)

2-rescuer CPR
In this case, for children and infants change compression to breath ratio to 15:2.
One rescuer performs compressions and the other provides rescue breaths.  The rescuer providing
breaths should also check for a pulse. Switch tasks if necessary.

Rescue Breathing: The victim shows signs of circulation (a pulse) but is not breathing.
    1 breath every 5 - 6 seconds for an adult
    Note: if you cannot make the chest rise, then reposition the airway, if that still does not work, the airway is obstructed, so perform CPR to relieve an airway obstruction.
Recovery Position:
    Victim on their side, this protects the airway by allowing fluid to drain out of the mouth.
    An unresponsive, breathing victim should be placed in the Recovery Position.

Defribulation
------------------------------------------
Chances of survival is directly related to amount of time between cardiac arrest and difribulation (around 10% every minute)

If the victim has no signs of ciculation, you may interrupt CPR to apply an AED.

1. Power the AED on
2. Apply adhesive pads to the victims bare chest
3. Stand clear of the victim
4. AED determines "shockable" or "not shockable"
5. If "shockable", then follow instructions to administer the shock

If "not shockable" and the victim is still unresponsible/has no pulse, then provide 2 minutes of CPR and allow, then allow the AED to re-analyze the victim.

Precautions:

1. Dry a wet victim's chest with a clean towel
2. Only use on an unresponsive victim with not signs of circulation
3. Stand clear while the AED is operating
4. Place around pacemaker and remove nitroglycerin patches

Advanced Care
------------------------------------------
Oral Airways: Used to maintain an open airway. Come in different sizes.
Nasal Airway: Used if patiest is responsive or has a gag reflex
Ventilation Masks: Covers victims mouth and nose, provides a one-way valve to prevent rescuer from coming in contact with the victims breath or fluids.
Bag-Valve Mask(BVM): Uses a bag instead of the recuers breath.  Usually requires 2 people to operate efficiently, so that one can use 2 hands to hold the mask tight.
  Note: most common problem is maintaining an open airway
Supplemental Oxygen Support(SOS): Delivers high concentrations of oxygen to breathing and non-breathing victims.  Import to have training to operate.
Suction Devices: Removes fluids from a victim's mouth (like vomit).
  Note: Vomiting is common during resuscitation and is a threat to the victims airway. Turn the victims head to the side to drain fluid and clear any large debres with a finger sweep.


Heart Attack
------------------------------------------
Symptoms:
    - Persistent chest pain lasting more than 3 to 5 minutes
    - Chest pain that travels to the neck, jaw or down the arm
    - Nasea, dizziness, extreme fatigue
    - Shortness of breath or trouble breathing
    - Sweating or cold sweat without fever

Prompt activation of EMS is crucial

While waiting, get an AED ready and get ready to perform CPR

Stroke
------------------------------------------
Causes: Blocked or Ruptured vessel to the brain
Symptoms:
    - Facial Droop
    - Altered responsiveness and/or severe headache
    - Visual Problems or Dizziness
    - Speaking difficulty or slurred speech
    - Weakness or paralysis of one or more limbs

EMS must be administered within 3 hours to control brain dammage

Airway Obstruction
------------------------------------------
If victim cannot cough or emit sound, they have no air exchange and require immediate recuer assistance.
A victim with a partially blocked airway will be able to cough or speak and will likely be able to free the object without direct assistance (encourage them to cough the obstruction free).

Signs:
    - Severe breathing difficulty
    - Changes in skin appearance or blue lips (cyanosis)
    - High pitched noises or inability to speak
    - Universal choking sign (clutching the throat)

How to perform abdominal thrusts:
    1. Make a fist with your thumb just above the navel
    2. Clasp your fist with your other hand
    3. Pull inward and upward with quick thrusts
    4. Continue the thrusts until the obstruction is removed or the victim becomes unresponsive

Note: if the victim is pregnant or too fat to reach around, perform chest compressions instead.  Line up the thumb in your first with the victims breastbone.

Perform abdominal thrusts on YOURSELF:
    If you are alone and choking, you can perform the thrusts yourself (line up thumb of the fist just above the navel).
    Or you can thrust your abdomen over a firm object, a chair could work.

With partial obstruction, encourage the victim to cough to free the object.


Pediatrics
------------------------------------------
Unlike adults, EMS can be called 2 minutes after giving care (for adults the EMS should be notified immediately).

Differences:


Reference Table
Choking         : Infant: back blows/chest thrusts
Rescue Breathing: Infant/Child: Breath every 3 - 5 seconds
CPR Compression : Infant/Child: 1/3 of chest depth (not 2" like adults)
CPR Compression : Infant: 2 fingers, child: 1 or 2 hands, adult: 2 hands

Choking
    - Place infant face DOWN on the forearm supporting head/jaw (keep head lower than body)
    - Deliver up to five back blows (slaps) between the infant's shoulder blands using the heel of your hand
    - Turn the infant face up
    - Deliver up to five chest thrusts (using two fingers on the sternum)
