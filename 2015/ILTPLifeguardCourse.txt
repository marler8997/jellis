ILTP Lifeguarding Course
===================================================

Introduction
------------------------------------------
The "standard of care" is the expected level of skills/care at which lifeguards are expected to perform.
For lifeguards who completed ILTP (International Lifeguard Training Program) this consists of:
    1. Proactive simmer protection that meets the 10/20 protection rule
    2. Test ready skill maintenance
    3. Demonstration of professional image
Ellis & Associates (E & A) Traning Areas of Emphasis
    1. Prevention
    2. Professionalism
        - Be Punctual
        - Be in proper uniform (neat/clean)
        - Be Prepared (have equipment)
        - Be Pleasant (act cordial to guests and coworkers)
        - Be Attentive (Keep eyes on guests and avoid distractions)
        - Be Vigilant (maintain skills and performance)
        - Be Knowledgeable (Know/Enfore the facility rules)
    3. Accountability
Skills
    1. Anticipate
    2. Recognize
    3. Respond

Awareness and Recognition
------------------------------------------
Lifeguard from the bottom up: If you don't know, GO!

Distress Signals
    1. Body Position (Diagonal or Vertical with Extended Arms)
    2. Little or no forward movement
    3. Head tilted, gasping for air, often unable to shout for help
5 Stages of Drowning
    1. Surprise
    2. Involuntary Breath Holding

    4. Hypoxic Convulsions (caused by lack of oxygen to the brain, person appears rigid/stiff/jerks violently and can froth from the mouth)
    5. Clinical Death
Passive Drowning (caused by heart attack, stroke, blackouts, seizures, head injury, drugs, or alcohol)
Active Drowning (May struggle on the surface for a short period before submerging)

Dry Drowning and Wet Drowning
    Dry (10 - 20%) Wet (80 - 90%)
    Based on whether whater is present in the lungs after death

Guests with greater potential for becoming distressed include
    1. Guests between age of 7 - 12
    2. Young children
    3. Smaller people who wade into deeper water

    6. Lake areas
Time of day
    1. Mid-day (12-4PM)
    2. Holidays
    3. Extremely hot days

Reacting to an emergency
------------------------------------------
When you activate your EAP, the lifeguard to your left should assume responsibility of your zone.
When you hear a whistle signaling an emergency, you should immeidately check the lifeguard to your right and cover his/her zone if necessary.
If there are not enough guards to cover the zones during a rescue, the attraction/facility must be closed temporarily and all guests cleared from the water.
Note: Remember to assess scene safety before entering a scene.
Note: Remember BSI (Body Substance Isolation)
    - Wear Gloves and wash immediately after removing them
    - Use Protective equipment for eyes/mouth
    - Dispose of needles and sharp objects properly
    - Clean other areas that might have been exposed to bodily fluids
Communication
    - Whistles (required to have one at all times while on duty)
    - Hand Signals
    - Other Devices (megaphones, etc)
Whistle
    - One short blast - Get attention of guests
    - Two short blasts - Get attention of lifeguards
        afterwards raise your hand or touch your head to let them know it was you who whistled
    - One long blast - Activate your EAP
        You are leaving your zone to perform a rescue, someone needs to cover your zone
        Point to where you are going
        (stop waves if in a wave pool)
    - Two long blasts - Major emergency
        May be a life-threatening situation in which several lifeguards/facility personnel are involved or needed.
        Pool may need to be closed immediately and guests cleared from the area.
Hand Signals
    - Rase Clenched Fist - I need help
        Can be used with a whistle blast
    - Crossed arms above the head - Stop dispatch of riders on water attractions.
        Can be used with a whistle blast to indicate a rescue in progress.
    - Thumbs up - It's alright to resume activity
    - Tapping the top of your head - Watch my area
        Usually accompanied by whistle blasts
Phone Numbers: 911 (EMS) 800-222-1222 (Poison Control)
Communcation Devices: Telephone, Radio, Megaphone, PA

"Assist": 10/20 maintained and EAP NOT activated
"Rescue": EAP activated (10/20 not maintained)

The average rescue tube can support up to 5 people in the water.
Rescue tube is placed between the lifeguard and the guest to protect the guard.
The rescue tube can also be used to help keep a guests airway open if they are not breathing.

Note: Some positions may not be required to wear a tube at all times (like a guard at

How to hold rescue tube:
	- When seated, hold in you lap

Rotation:
	- Incoming guard performs bottom scan.
	- Equipment is transferred. (if only one rescue tube)
	- Incoming guard takes the stand while outgoing scans zone.
	- Both guards scan zone.

Always have your rescue tube ready!

	- Speak with authority
Incident Reports must be completed immediately afterwards.
You must always maintain your skills at a test-ready level.


Guest on the Surface-Breathing
------------------------------------------
Extension Assist
	Extend a body part/pole/rescue tube.
	No need for EAP if you maintain 10/20.
	Stay low
	In an arm assist, grab the guests wrist
Unlike assists, rescues require an incident report. They are also classified in 2 ways:
	1. Distressed Simmer Rescue - Guest who has shown an inability to remain at the surface.
	2. Submersion Incident Rescue - Rescuing an unconscious and submerged guest
Rescue Situations
	- Guest on surface, breathing
	- Guest on surface, not breathing
	- Submerged - within reach
	- Submerged - beyond reach
EAP ensures that all zones are covered.

Compact Jump
	- Keep eyes on guest
	- Secure excess line on rescue tube so it will not hook onto something
	- Position rescue tube across chest and under armpits
	- Jump into water, knees bent, legs together, feet flat
Approach Stroke (Breaststroke or Front Crawl)
	Keep eyes on guest and rescue tube in front of chest

Front Drive
	- Whistle, point to guest, then perform a compact jump
	- When close, pull the rescue tube from under your arms and push it out in front of you with both arms locked.
	- As you near the guest, push the tube slightly underwater and drive it into the chest of the guest.  Keep arms locked straight.
	- Encourage the guest to hold on to the tube.
	- Communicate with the guest and keep kicking to maintain your momentum till at the side of the pool.  Assist the guest from the water and make sure they are allright before transferring care to the supervisor to resume guarding.
	(Front Hug)
		- If the guest grabs you and you can keep your head above water then reach under the guests arms and hug them as you continue to safety.  If the guest is forcing you under water, it is best to leave them on the rescue tube and push away, then re-approach.  An additional lifeguard may be needed.
Rear Hug
	- Whistle, point to guest, then perform a compact jump
	- When you reach the guest, extend your arms under their armpits and wrap your hands around their shoulders or chest.
	- Pull the guest onto the tube while keeping your head to the side. Talk to the guest until you reach safety.
Two-Lifeguard Rescue
	- Primary rescuer raises a fist above their head to indicate the need for assistance from another guard.
	- The second lifeguard performs a Rear Hug while the first guard performs a front drive.

Guest on the surface not breathing
------------------------------------------
1. Perform a rear hug rescue
2. Pull the guest backward across the rescue tube; Signal for equipment (backboard/resuscitation mask), Once it arrives, perform rescue breathing
3. Note: use Jaw-thrust with head tilt to open the airway

Rescue Breathing and Airway Management
------------------------------------------
Opening Airway of Unconscious guest
	1. Jaw thrust with Head Tilt
	2. Head tilt withe chain lift
	3. (Possible Neck Injury) Jaw thrust WITHOUT Head Tilt
For Unconscious guests, occasional gasping breaths may be "Agonal Breaths", which are ineffective.  If you see agonal breaths, then rescue breathing should be provided.

Rapid Extraction
    Can be done with as few as 2 lifeguards using a backgoard.
    Only used when guest is not breathing and does not have a suspected spinal injury.

1. Primary lifeguard moves the guest toward the side of the pool
2. Secondary lifeguard places the backboard vertical underwater against the side of the pool.
3. Primary guard moves to the side and raises the guest's arms so the secondary lifeguard can grasp the wrist.
    - Primary guard slides the rescue tube away before the guest rests on the backboard
4. Secondary guard holds the backboard with one hand and the guest's wrist in the other.
    - Primary guard stabalizes the backboard in the water.

Once on land
- Move the guest 6 feet from the edge of the water.
- Check responsiveness, if not responsive, check for signs of obvious breathing such as chest movement, then check for pulse.
- If no pulse and no breathing, begin CPR and communicate the need for an AED.
- If guest has a pulse but no breathing, perform rescue breathing for 2 minutes.

Submerged guest
------------------------------------------
Duck and Pluck rescue (Submerged guest within reach)
    - Grasp rescue tube with one hand.
    - Reach over the tube to grab the wrist of the submerged guest
    - Pull them up and with the other hand push the rescue tube under their armpits

Deep Water Rescue
    - When directly above the guest, stop and release the rescue tube from under your armpits (be sure the strap is still across your chest/shoulder)
    - Execute a feet-first surface dive
    - With one hand, reach across the guest's chest under the armpits. Feed the strap of the rescue tube into that hand.
    - Continue feeding the strap as you move toward the surface (make sure at least one hand is always holding the strap)
    - When you reach the surface, position the rescue tube appropriately based on the guest's condition


Spinal Injury Management
------------------------------------------
Causes
    - Blows/Dives/Falls
    - When the neck is extended or flexed to far, common in diving injuries
Signs
    - Blood around ears/nose
    - Confusion
    - Deformity around neck
    - Bruising around face/heck/neck
    - Neck/Back pain
    - Numbness/tingling/inability to move limbs or neck normally
Care for spinal injury is a team effort.
For a spinal injury, do not perform a compact jump if they are close to you, instead, ease gently into the water so as not to disturb the surface
Use a ViceGrip rescue
    - FaceUp Vice Grip (Overarm Vice Grip)
        - Use one arm to grsp the guests arms just above the elbows at or around the ears, Press arms agains the ears
    - If the guest is face-down, use the Underarm Vicegrip to roll them face-up
If they are in deep water, perform the vice grip underwater and move diagonally to the surface to minize bending of the spine
    Roll them face up as you ascend to the surface


Handling Risks
------------------------------------------
Lifeguard should be involved in at least 4 hours of in-service training each month
Handling Risks
    - Eye Injury: Polarized Ultraviolet Sunglasses
Best Defense against a lawsuit
    - Be Attentive, Effecient and Skilled


CPR and AED
------------------------------------------
AED Special Concerns
	- Water: keep guest at least 6 feet away from pool.  Dry chest and pads.
	- Children: Some AEDs have special pads for children
	- Remove any medication patches underneath pads.
	- Do not place pads directly above pacemakers

Supplemental Oxygen Support
------------------------------------------
Do not expose to temperatures above 130 degrees F (54 degress C)

BVM (Bag Valve Mask)
    - Self-refilling bag
    - Non-rebreathing valve
    - Various sizes for children and adults
    - Reservoir system for high concentrations of oxygen
    - Most Common Problem: Failure to provide an adequate volume of air

===================================================
Exam Notes
===================================================
* The non-breathing mask attached to a supplemental oxygen system is a device that can be used by lifeguards when the following symptoms are found:
    Conscious breathing guests who have difficulty breathing and/or are suffering from a medical condition that requires supplemental oxygen, such as a heart attack, stroke, seizure, or a recent submersion event
* The ILTP Course Completion Card and E&A License are valid for?
    1 Year from date of course completion
* How can a lifeguard team modify the use of an adult bag valve mask (BVM) for use on children?
    The lifeguard squeezing the bag carefully observes the chest.  The lifeguard squeezes just enough to produce visible chest rise.
* Rapid extrication procedures:
    Are used to quickly and safely remove a non-breathing guest from the water
* Lifeguard Rotation?
    Incoming lifeguard performance a profound, proactive bottom scan to determine if the zone is clear.  Once the zone is clear, the incoming lifeguard can begin normal scanning while the outgoing lifeguard performance a profound, proactive bottom scan to determine if the zone is clear.  The lifeguards should signal to each other that both have determined that the zone is clear before the rotation is complete.
* Shallow save
    Duck pluck rescue
* Duck Pluck rescue on a submerged guest
    Rescuer holds the tube in the middle with one hand while the other hand is used to reach over the tube toward the guest.  The may require the lifeguard's head to be submerged to grab the guest's hand or arm to pull him or her to the surface.
* C.A.R.E
    confidence, alertness, responsiveness, empathy
* Technique used to immobilize the head and neck of a guest with a suspected spinal injury
    Vice grip
* When the lifeguard team is securing a guest to a backboard, the team should
    Secure the guest's body (chest, hips, thighs, and lower legs) to the backboard before securing the head (using a head immobilizer)
* For documentation and reporting, rescures are classified in one of two ways depending on the severity of the incident.
    A "Distressed Swimmer Rescue" and a "Submersion Incident Rescue"
* When a lifeguard provides breaths for a non-breathing guest with an open airway and a pulse, that lifeguard is performing
    Rescue Breathing
* What are the first basic steps lifeguards follow when presented with a submerged guest with a suspected spinal injury?
    Lifeguards should position their bodies so that they are just above the submerged guest. Feet-first surface dive to the depth of the guest and apply the vise grip, just as would be done at the surface.  Bring the guest up on a diagonal approach, slowly turning the guests face up as you ascend.
* Two lifeguards are backboarding a large man who performanced a deep water dive in the shallow end.  What techniques will assist the lifeguards in managing the large guest?
    The lifeguard team can bring the guest to shallow water (if possible) so they can stand without support of the rescue tubes.
    Once the guest is placed on the board, a rescue tube can be placed under the board, near the feet to provide added stability while the guest is being secured.
    When it is time to extricate, the lifeguards should slide the board onto the deck using good communication and teamwork, avoiding lifting the board (if possible)
* AED used to treat:
    No pulse, which may be caused by ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia
* How do lifeguards reduce likelihood of being held liable?
    Always stay attentive and maintain the 10/20 protection standard; attend regular documented in-service training to maintain skills; act maturely and professional while on duty
* Proper location for a one-rescuer CPR on an infant?
    2 fingers on the breatbone, just below the nipple line
* CPR compressions and breath ratios
    Single rescuer, all age groups: 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths.
    Multiple rescuers: adult, 30 compressions followed by 2 breaths.
                       child/infant, 15 compressions followed by 2 breaths
* BSI (Body substance isolation) refers to:
    Treating all body fluids as if they are contaminated and using appropriate PPE (personal protective devices) to avoid direct contact
* 10/20 protection standard:
    Allow up to 10 seconds to recognize a guest in distress, and 20 seconds to reach and render aid
* CAB sequence for basic life support
    If they are unresponsive and no obvious signs of breathing:
        - Activate the EAP/EMS
        - Request an AED
        - Take BSI precautions
        - First check the pulse, after not finding one, immediately begin CPR (begin with compressions)
        -  Call for an AED to be prepared and attached
* Guest is partially submerged and appears rigid with jerking motions.  Skin is blue and froth is coming from the mouth.
    This is the Hypoxic convulsions stage
* NOTE: EAP = Emergency Action Plan
* A lifeguard is on the stand with no lifeguard to her left. Who will maintain her zone if she has to perform a rescue?
    The lifeguard to her right can cover the zone, or if possible, the lifeguard directly accross the pool can cover the zone of protection, following the facility's EAP.
* While scanning your zone of protection it is best to:
    Rescue all guests who show any signs of distress.  If you are not sure or if you don't know, go!
* The AED
    Can be used on a person of any age when they are found: unconscious, without ibvious normal breathing, and without a definite pulse
* Infant choking
    Support the infant's head and neck, and firmly administer five back blows and then five chest thrusts, repeating until the baby can breathe or becomes unconscious.
* AED has been applied to a guest. Next step is:
    Immediately perform CPR, beginning with compressions until prompted by the AED to stand clear (approximately 2 mintues)
* ILTP course requires lifeguard to
    Shallow water lifeguards: 50 yards; Pool lifeguards: 100 yards; Special Facilities lifeguards: 200 yards
* Rescue breathing for children is performed at a rate of
    1 rescue breath every 3 - 5 seconds
* Note: lifeguard must wear the recue tube at all times
* Suspected spinal injury on deck (non-aquatic)
    Focus on basic stabilization and prevention of further injury until qualified emergency medical professionals arrive
* When using AED, one thing to consider
    The wet deck and the need to move the guest at least six feet away from the water (to use the AED)
* Hot day, woman started twitching then stopped.  Guest is not conscious and responding slowly to questions but seems confused.  She may have had a seizure, because:
    Heatstroke or fever, head injury, or low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)
* Factors that make it difficult for a lifeguard to recognize a guest in distress include
    Location in the water, glare, and water clarity
